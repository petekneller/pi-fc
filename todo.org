* TODO refactor spidev tests -> integration tests
* DONE refactor device/api: move impls of rx and tx into device/controller, squash device/configuration, separate file and spi controllers
* DONE figure out how to remove the concept of 'register' from controllers, since uBlox GPS isn't register-based (is message-based)
** +remove the =Register= type member+
** +=SpiControllerTest= uses a =Device= impl whereas the =FileControllerTest= uses raw =Address=, =Controller=, =Rx=, =Tx= - change =SpiControllerTest= to be consistent+
** +=RcAddressTest= and =PwmAddressTest= work against the mock file api - move them up to using mock controllers?+
** +refine the types of =chip= and =channel= to be positive (and limited?) in =PwmAddress=+
