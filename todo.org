* TODO spi-to-tcp
** +v1: instead of looping constantly just add a thread sleep or other? And read > 1 byte?+
*** +extend =BidirectionalController= to transmit > 1 byte; further unit tests+
** +see what it looks like with fs2 (or cats-effect async stuff?)+
** move from byte-based to message-based transfers
*** nmea message parsing
**** add some way of turning it back to bytes
**** family polymorphism between Message and MessageParser? (return type of MessageParser)
**** add checksum-ing
*** ublox message parsing
**** add checksum-ing
* TODO convert from SBT to MIll and refactor spidev tests -> integration tests
* DONE refactor device/api: move impls of rx and tx into device/controller, squash device/configuration, separate file and spi controllers
* DONE figure out how to remove the concept of 'register' from controllers, since uBlox GPS isn't register-based (is message-based)
** +remove the =Register= type member+
** +=SpiControllerTest= uses a =Device= impl whereas the =FileControllerTest= uses raw =Address=, =Controller=, =Rx=, =Tx= - change =SpiControllerTest= to be consistent+
** +=RcAddressTest= and =PwmAddressTest= work against the mock file api - move them up to using mock controllers?+
** +refine the types of =chip= and =channel= to be positive (and limited?) in =PwmAddress=+
* DONE rename Rx and Tx impls
** +StringRxTx+
** +File system Rx/Tx impls can now be case classes+
** +StringConfiguration+
** +ByteRxTx+
** +Spi Rx/Tx impls can now be case classes+
** +ByteConfiguration+
** +ByteRx should internally use BytesRx+
