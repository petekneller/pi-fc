/*
 * Rx and Tx represent _things_ that can be transferred to/from a device, eg. a bit, byte, word,
 * sequence of bytes, configuration parameter/s.
 * They build on the underlying Controller API and make it easier to encapsulate logical transactions
 * that you might wish to make.
 * It is implied that the underlying controller supports half-duplex comms - that reads and writes
 * can be made independently.
