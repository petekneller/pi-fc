/*
 * 'Device' is a simple convenience which bundles a device address and controller together.
 * It's unlikely the controller associated with a device (address) will change over the course of an
 * application so this makes it easier to manage.
 * The HalfDuplexDevice utilises Rx's and Tx's to abstract over the transfer protocol, which implies
 * that half-duplex transfers are available.
